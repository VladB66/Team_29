# Mulatschak Tracker - Track all your game stats digitally



# Vision / Idea
Vision: No more tracking your Mulatschak games per hand

Idea: The idea of this app is to create a tracker for your local Mulatschak game. This solves the problem of needing pen and paper to play the game. Additionally, it solves problems of cheating and makes the rules clear to everyone.
You should also be able to modify the ruleset to your liking (as this is a pub card game, rules can differ a lot).

Feature List:
- Score Tracking
- Different Rulesets
- Statistics of your Game
- Filter/View past Games

Advanced Feature List:
- Store Multiple Players
- Teaching Section
- Tips and Tricks
- Extended Tracker for Other games such as Watten, Schnapsn
